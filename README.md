# Automatic_Invoice
A simple MS Word document copier that fills in details automatically – mostly for repeat invoices.

v01-v03 changelogs lost to time.
v04 will come in time.
And more when I have the time.

# Plan
 I want to use Python as my back end, and Java as my front end.

 I had already made a functional Python script beforehand, but I feel like 'TKinter' – Python's answer to easy GUI – is ideal for my circumstances.
 
 Java has the tools and functionality I prefer – and this whole thing would be a great exercise for my ability in documentation, programming, etc.

 I would also be able to use the script I wrote, thus saving me some time and effort.
