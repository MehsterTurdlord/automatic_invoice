# Automatic_Invoice
A simple MS Word document copier that fills in details automatically â€“ mostly for repeat invoices.

v01-v03 changelogs lost to time.
v04 will come in time.
And more when I have the time.

# Plan
In this purely-python edition of the sort-of-an-app, I intend to use Tkinter to act as the GUI.

Version 1.0:
I will make a new script that acts as the GUI service, while the previous code will remain universal to this and the Java edition.

It will be purely functional, 
have an input for every input,
and a button for the two options of clearing some or starting the input anew.

Version 2.0:
I will configure items to increase its functionality after some field tests.

Version 3.0:
I will think about a greater and more seamless UX.
